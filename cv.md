Problem from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/60908bc1d5811f0025474291)

Complete the function that takes an odd integer (0 < n < 1000000) which is the difference between two consecutive perfect squares, and return these squares as a string in the format "bigger-smaller".
### **Solution**:

```
const findSquares = num => {
  
  let max = ((num+1)/2) ** 2;
  
  let min = ((num+1)/2-1) ** 2;

  return `${max}-${min}`;
  
};
